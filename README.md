# Mastodon Glitch Edition (jordemort's personal fork)

This is my fork of the [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon) fork of Mastodon.

I may or may not use this.
You probably shouldn't.
I make no representations with regard to being up-to-date, functional, maintained, or available long-term.

## Features beyond plain Glitch

- The long-running emoji reactions patch: https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon/pull/2462
- Treehouse's version of quote posts, via NeuromatchAcademy: https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/mastodon/pull/52
  - I had my own kang of these patches for a while but I failed to bring them up-to-date :)
- Opportunistic notification for quote boosts and pseudo-mentions: https://github.com/VyrCossont/mastodon/pull/6

- robots.txt generated from https://darkvisitors.com/ (also borrowed from NeuromatchAcademy)
- Some tweaks around how status cards and links are displayed, because I fucking hate shit getting truncated
- "Post" is now "Squonk"
